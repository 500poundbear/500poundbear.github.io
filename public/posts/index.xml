      <description>&lt;p&gt;Usecase: A new service had to return json responses in different key case formats. Some endpoints were returning in `kebab-case` while others were returning in the more common `camelCase` format.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We went with a solution where we defaulted to `camelCase` as the default JSON marshaling format. For the other `kebab-case` endpoints the idea was to add a `Content-Type` header that would signal the alternate casing. This was logic that was added on our Kong request gateway/load balancer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
