Some endpoints were returning responses in <code>kebab-case</code> while others were returning in the more common <code>camelCase</code> format.</p>
<p>We went with a solution where we defaulted to <code>camelCase</code> as the default JSON marshaling format in the response. For the <code>kebab-case</code> endpoints the idea was to force a <code>Content-Type</code> header that would signal the alternate casing. This was logic that was added on our Kong request gateway/load balancer. The service would return the response format accordingly based on that header.</p>
<p>This was what I configured initially:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">Add - For adding the `Content-Type` header when the it is not present in the request
</code></pre><p>When testing on integration I realised the above was not enough to handle requests when the <code>Content-Type</code> was set. I realised that I also needed the <code>Replace</code> configuration, to cover the case when the caller has already specified the header and we want to overwrite that.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">Replace - For replacing the `Content-Type` header if it is present in the request
</code></pre><p><strong><strong>TIL</strong></strong>: I needed both `add` and `replace` specified in the Kong ACL to force a specific `Content-Type`, regardless of whether the header was specified by the caller or not.</p>
